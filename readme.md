# Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyse the gun voilence inside NYPD. However, the project doesn't go too deep. It was a successful attempt to learn R through this project.

I made graphical analysis and data filtering with R and then later visualized the data as it can be seen in the qmd file.


{I like playing with data and haven't had the chance to play with data through R before. It was a experience that I wanted to acquire.}

# Development Environment

I coded R in VS Code which I dont' think was a wise decision.

I used the libraries such as Tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2.
