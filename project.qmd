# Executive summary
In the year of 2022 only, there were approximately 1300 shootings within NYPD. The number, despite being a small reduction from last year with 17% decrease, it is still a huge number. From the data provided by NYPD which is available in Kaggle.com, I have made some analysis and the following graphs were pulled up from it.
![Police in background](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1838768/shootings-down-june-nypd-reports.jpg)

## Which age group and what race falls under highest shootings in NY?

The code evidently shows that the people with Black racial background have been reported to have more shooters than any other race despite 
having the population of only 23% of the city which is then followed by white hispanic population.

```{r}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and Format Data

bar_plot_age <- function(){
    data <- filter(my_data, PERP_AGE_GROUP!= "(null)")
    graph <- ggplot(data, aes(PERP_AGE_GROUP, fill = PERP_AGE_GROUP)) + 
        geom_bar(stat = "count")+
        labs(titel = "The number of different age groups getting shot")
    return(graph)
}

bar_plot_race <- function(){
    data <- filter(my_data, PERP_RACE!= "(null)")
    graph <- ggplot(data, aes(PERP_RACE, fill = PERP_RACE)) + 
        geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
        labs(title = "The number of groups getting shot based on race")
    return(graph)
}
plot1 <- bar_plot_age()
plot2 <- bar_plot_race()

print(grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 2))

```

The graph above shows which age group is more vulnerable to shooting and what race has more presense on such shootings.

## Question 2: Was the shooting rate same form the starting to end or, what upheavel pattern could be seen?

Throughout the year of 2022, the shooting incidents weren't so normally distributed. The folowing graph shows the trend on when the shooting was more common than others.

```{r}

#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: plot
#|fig-align: center
line_graph_race <- function(){
    data <- filter(my_data, PERP_RACE != "(null)")
    data <- filter(data, OCCUR_DATE != "(null)")
    
    data$OCCUR_DATE <- (as.Date(data$OCCUR_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
    print(data$OCCUR_DATE[1:5])
    data$binned <- cut(data$OCCUR_DATE, breaks = 10)
    print(data$binned[1:2])

    

    graph <- ggplot(data, aes(x = binned, group = PERP_RACE,
     color = PERP_RACE)) + 
        geom_freqpoly(stat = "count") + 
        labs(title = "The time graph for NYPD shooting different race of people over one year",
        subtitle = "The count of BLACK people getting killed is significantly higher than any other race and then it is followed by White Hispanic.")

    return(graph)
}



print(line_graph_race())

```


## Conclusion
In conclusion, it indicates that the along with economical ties and other sad circumstances, including the economical gap of  $55,570 average household income to staggering $103,551 income for white household, the shooting numbers are high too. It shows the economical and educational gap between the races of one of the worlds largest city and proves how the voilence is a economical factor.
